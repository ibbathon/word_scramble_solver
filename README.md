# Word Scramble Solver

Solves word-scramble puzzles (e.g. build 10 words from the letters THINK). In particular, it accepts a single parameter consisting of any number of letters. It then runs through all permutations of those letters, compares them to a dictionary, and outputs all valid words (unique, sorted by length, then alpha).
